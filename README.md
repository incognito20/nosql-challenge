### Summary

The NoSQL Challenge is a full NoSQL and data analysis project using data about restaurants in the United Kingdom. It involves importing data into a MongoDB, preparing and modifying the data, and then performing analysis to answer various questions.

### File Information

NoSQL_setup_starter_.ipynb = The code required to complete Part 1 as described below.

NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb = The code required to complete Parts 2 and 3 as described below.

establishments.json = The json list of information that was imported to create the datbase.


### Part 1

In Part 1 of this challenge the code creates a database and collection using the provided JSON and verifies the data exists.

### Part 2

In Part 2 of this challenge the code looks to perform several activites including modifying the data based on the criteria provided by adding an additional entry to the data,
updating specific fields, removing all documents that contain the Dover Local Authority, and changing the data type of some fields from string to int or decimal.

In Part 3 of this challenge the code looks to answer specific questions that can be determined using the data. The questions are as follows:

<ul>
<li>Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?</li>

<li>Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?</li>
